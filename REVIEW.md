# FrontEnd Test

This project was written in about three hours and was a very
fun experience. I've never worked with Knockout before but I
found it to be very similar to Angular and it didn't take too
long to get a descent understanding of the framework. I chose
to use Bootstrap as my CSS framework since it is easy and quick
to use. I would have liked to get further into your technology
stack, I might try and add more to it later. One thing I would
liked to have included was a timestamp for each commit posted.
However, I am happy with the mobile-friendly and fully responsive
app that I have created. Thanks for reviewing my code!
